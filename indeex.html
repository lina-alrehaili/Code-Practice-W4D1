                    <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
                    <p>Computers connected to the Web are called clients and servers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clients are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer
                            connected to your Wi-F1, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and Web-accessing
                            software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                        <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to
                            access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client
                            machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="###" alt="client and server img">
                    <h3>So What Actually Happens?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The browser goes to the DNS server and finds the real address of the server that the website
                            lives on. </li>
                        <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server asking it to send a copy of the
                            website to the client.</li>
                        <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message,
                            which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files
                            to the browser as a series of small chunks.</li>
                        <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you! </li>
                    </ol>

                            <p>While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that they
                                serve to the client are always going to be some combination of HTML, CSS, and
                                JavaScript!
